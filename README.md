# Cat Quiz Game

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by Nagagu.

## Project Explanation

In this case I wanted to use an external API in a original way so I decided to make a game.

On this project I try to show my skills using React, Redux and CSS.
